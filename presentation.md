### Tool which helps to *achieve software security*.

---

## Key features

* Scan dependencies
* Scan source code

---

## Dependencies scanning

* Detects more than npm audit, e.g. [#305](https://github.com/camunda-community-hub/zeebe-client-node-js/pull/305).
* Scans production deps only per default (no usual npm audit hassle!).

---

## Code scanning a.k.a. Snyk Code

* Analyze source code for potential vulnerabilities, e.g. [#3475](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-modeler/pull/3475)

---

## Docker images scanning

* Useful for most teams at Camunda.

---

## Getting started

* Let's have a look at the tool: https://app.snyk.io/

---

## Next steps

* Create a team
